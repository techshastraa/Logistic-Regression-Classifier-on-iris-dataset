# üå∏ Iris Binary Classification using Logistic Regression

This project applies **Logistic Regression** for **binary classification** on the famous **Iris dataset**. The model predicts flower species based on four features: sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width. It uses `scikit-learn` for model training, evaluation, and visualization.

## üìò Project Description

The Iris dataset includes samples from three flower species. For this project, we reduce the problem to binary classification by selecting only two species (e.g., *Setosa* vs *Versicolor*). The goal is to train a model that accurately classifies flowers into one of the two categories.

The steps include:
- Data preprocessing and feature scaling
- Model training using Logistic Regression
- Evaluation using accuracy, confusion matrix, and ROC AUC score
- Visualization with ROC curve and confusion matrix
